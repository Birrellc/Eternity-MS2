## Description

*this is a ficticious business created for my milestone project 2 with the code institute*

A luxuary minimalistic restaurant website designed to convey upper market fine dining experience with high quality food and service. The user of this website will have a taste for high quality foods delivered in a sophisticated environment while eating out but also have the option to eat from home with an online delivery service which i decided to use as thats how many restaurants are managing to survive due to the current pandemic.

*Frontend only - backend databases for reservation and paygate for the online orders to be added as i progress during the course*

## UX

### Landing Page

The landing page design i have chosen follows a minimalist approach which will follow throughout the website due to current trends i find minimalism conveys luxuary very well. This will consist of a simple image background for both light and dark modes which there will be a button in place to toggle between both modes to provide comfort to the viewers/users preference. A title displayed vertically to capture interest with a horizontal sub heading to draw contrast from the heading with a call to action button to book a table below. There will be 3 bar navigation button (hamburger menu) to allow users to open a navigation menu to explore the website or they could scroll down with smooth scrolling and also this allows 
users to best experience the website and it's animation effects.

### About Us

The About Us page design is simple but informative - 2 images are placed on the right with a summary of the history of the rest restaurant on the left in order to give the user a view of the experience they will recieve in the restaurant and also to provide the user with a view of how the restaurant looks. To the left of these images will be a brief snippet of text explaining how the restaurant started to build an emotional connection with the user.

### Menu

The Menu page is nice and simple, the menu options are displayed by images of what the finished dish looks like to provide the user a viewing of the quality food they can expect to recieve at the restaurant. Also as the restaurant offers online delivery service an add to basket button is displayed with each menu item for the user to then add to their online order and purchase for delivery if they do so require.

### Reservations

The Reservations page is kept very minimalistic but informative of all the information the customer requires to book a table at the restaurant while also providing a map of the restaurant location, contact details, address and last but not least a call to action button to allow the customer to book a table at the restaurant.

### Contact Us

This page is a simple form with an image behind it with another linear gradient over to top of it to not be so overpowering for the user, the form on this page will allow the user to contact the restaurant with any complaints, suggestions or questions they may have for the restaurant.

### User Stories
