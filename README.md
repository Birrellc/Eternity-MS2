### User Stories

User:

* As a user of this website i would like to be able to browse what food is available before going to the premises so that i would not be wasting my time if there was no options i wanted.
* As a user, i want to be able to submit feedback to the restaurant of any suggestions, complaints or just to receive more information by email and phone incase my issue is urgent or not so urgent.
* As a user, i want to be able to see what kind of environment the restaurant has through images to see if its the kind of place i would feel comfortable or to see if there is an outdoor area incase i choose to eat her in the summer.
* As a user, i would like the option to book food online and by telephone so i can make a reservation in whichever manner is convenient to me.
